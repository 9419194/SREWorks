## Introduction

Alibaba's big data SRE team cloud-native operation platform SREWorks, precipitated the SRE engineering practice of the team after nearly 10 years of internal business training, adhering to the "data-based, intelligent" operation and maintenance thinking, to help more practitioners in the operation and maintenance industry to adopt the "data intelligence" thinking to do a good job in efficient operation and maintenance.

In 2003, a position called SRE (Site Reliability Engineer) was proposed by Google. It is a combination of software engineers and system administrators, laying emphasis on the development capabilities of operation and maintenance personnel, and requiring them to spend less than 50% of their energy on the operation and maintenance of daily chores, and the other 50% on the development of automation tools to reduce manpower requirements.

As an engineering practice for the SRE concept of the Alibaba Cloud big data SRE team, SREWorks focuses on the application-centric one-stop "cloud native" and "data intelligence" operation and maintenance SaaS management suite. It provides two core capabilities of enterprise application & Resource Management and O & M development to help enterprises realize the delivery and maintenance of cloud-native applications & Resources.


Alibaba Cloud big data SRE team is naturally close to big data and AI, is very familiar with Big Data & AI technology, and has the big data and AI computing power resources on demand, has been working hard to practice the "data", "intelligent" operation and maintenance concept, the industry's DataOps (data operation and maintenance) first proposed by the team. There is a set of end-to-end DataOps closed-loop engineering practices in the SREWorks, including standard O & M warehouses, data operation and maintenance platforms, and operation centers.

In the traditional IT O & M field, there are a large number of excellent open source O & M platforms, which reflect cloud-native scenarios. At present, there is still a lack of systematic O & M solutions. With the advent of the general trend in the cloud-native era, the Alibaba Cloud big data SRE team will SREWorks the open source operation and maintenance platform, hoping to provide operation and maintenance engineers with an out-of-the-box operation and maintenance platform.
